    ## Welcome to the Derivatives Risk Assessment Tool!

    This interactive application is designed to help you understand the risk associated with derivative portfolios. 
    By adjusting various parameters, you can visualize how different market conditions and derivative specifications 
    impact potential portfolio outcomes. This tool is for educational purposes and uses a synthetic dataset to 
    demonstrate key concepts in derivatives risk management.

    **Learning Outcomes:**
    - Gain a clear understanding of derivatives risk factors.
    - Learn how changes in input parameters affect portfolio risk.
    - Visualize risk using interactive charts and graphs.
    - Understand the sensitivity of derivative positions to market variables.

    Let's start by configuring your synthetic derivative portfolio in the sidebar to the left.

    ### Understanding Derivatives Risk

    Derivatives risk assessment involves evaluating potential losses in a derivative portfolio due to changes in market conditions. 
    Key factors influencing derivative risk include:

    - **Notional Amount**: The total value of the contract, scaling potential gains and losses.
    - **Underlying Asset**: The asset the derivative's value is derived from. Different assets have different risk profiles.
    - **Option Type (Call/Put)**: Determines whether the derivative profits from price increases (Call) or decreases (Put).
    - **Strike Price**: The price at which the option can be exercised. Closer to the current price, the option is more sensitive to price changes.
    - **Expiration Date**: Time until the option expires. Longer timeframes generally increase option value and risk.
    - **Volatility**: Measures the degree of price fluctuation of the underlying asset. Higher volatility increases option value but also risk.
    - **Interest Rate**: Affects the cost of carry and present value calculations for derivatives.
    - **Market Scenarios**: Different economic conditions can significantly impact derivative values.

    Below, we visualize the potential profit and loss (P&L) and risk sensitivity of your synthetic derivative portfolio 
    based on the parameters you've set.

    - **Option Payoff**: The profit or loss realized when an option is exercised or expires. Call options profit from price increases above the strike price, while put options profit from price decreases below the strike price.
    - **Volatility Impact**: Higher volatility generally increases the value of options because there's a greater chance of the underlying asset's price moving significantly, either profitably or unprofitably. This tool simplifies the impact for visual understanding.
    - **Interest Rate Influence**: Interest rates affect the present value of future payoffs. Higher interest rates can increase the value of call options and decrease the value of put options, but the impact is often complex and depends on various factors.
    - **Market Scenarios and Stress Testing**: Assessing portfolio risk under different market scenarios is crucial for stress testing. It helps understand how the portfolio might perform in extreme or unexpected conditions. This application provides a simplified way to consider these scenarios.

    **Disclaimer**: This tool is for educational purposes only and uses a simplified model for derivative risk assessment. 
    Real-world derivative pricing and risk management are significantly more complex and involve sophisticated models and market data. 
    Consult with financial professionals for actual investment and risk management decisions.
